### S1-AlgIt.mlx 
Trust-region, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm methods are compared for estimated nonlinear CO2 photoreduction kinetic models. The Trust_region algorithm was modified to include a median approach that yields reproducible coefficient estimates

### S2-MedIt.mlx 
A mean median multi-start trust-region method is used to estimate nonlinear CO2 photoreduction kinetic model coefficients using data from existing literature
