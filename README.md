# mean-median-method

This is a collection of MATLAB markdown scripts as a walk-through describing the numerical methods presented in the publication () .

In S1-AlgIt.mlx: Trust-region, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm methods are compared for estimated nonlinear CO2 photoreduction kinetic models. The Trust_region algorithm was modified to include a median approach that yields reproducible coefficient estimates

In S2-MedIt.mlx: A mean median multi-start trust-region method is used to estimate nonlinear CO2 photoreduction kinetic model coefficients using data from existing literature
